                <h2>Places to Stay</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the small size of our wedding, we are unable to secure discounted hotel prices for guests not
                    staying at the lodge.
                    <br/>
                    However, we have found a number of available places to stay at various price points.
                    <br/>
                    Here are some of the better available options, from least to most expensive:
