            <h2>COVID-19 Protocol</h2>
            <p>
                COVID-19 is still very much a problem, and we unfortunately do not anticipate it no longer being a problem by the time of the wedding.
                To protect ourselves and our guests, we will be taking the following protocols throughout the weekend:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>You must be vaccinated to attend any portion of the wedding weekend.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whenever you arrive at the lodge, you will be asked to take a rapid COVID-19 test, which we will provide.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Anyone who tests positive will only be able to participate in the outdoor portions of the weekend and must wear an N95 or KN95 mask, which we will provide.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you are staying at the lodge and test positive, we will help you find alternative accommodations for the weekend.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will not be requiring masks if you test negative, but you are welcome to wear one if that makes you more comfortable.
                </li>
            </ul>
