                The lodge is about 25 minutes outside the nearest town, Woodland Park.<br>
                A decent portion of the drive to the lodge from Woodland Park is along an unpaved road that is steep and
                narrow at times.<br>
                If you are staying at the lodge or in Woodland Park, we recommend driving down to Colorado Springs and approaching from the south.<br>

                    On the afternoon of the ceremony (10/8), a shuttle will be available to take you to and from the lodge if you are staying at one of the recommended hotels.

                <li>
                    Any other time, you can drive yourself to and from the lodge if you are comfortable driving along an unpaved road. Otherise, you may be able to find an Uber/Lyft from downtown Woodland Park. Be prepared for a wait. You may want to reserve it ahead of time to ensure there is a car available.
